ComScan: ComBat the Scanner effect
==================================

This repository implement ComBat and AutoComBat describe in `Carré, et
al. (2022) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16609-1>`__.

Introduction
------------

Current harmonization/normalization methods such as ComBat use a Bayes
parametric empirical framework to robustly adjust the data to site /
scanner effects. This method requires a representative statistical
sample and is therefore not suitable for radiomics machine learning
models for clinical translation, where the emphasis is on evaluating
individual scans from previously unseen scanners. In addition, it may
not always be obvious to define a batch effect that would be linked to
the site or scanners, as a change in a machine parameter may be more
appropriate for another scanner type or site. AutoComBat has thus been
implemented, and it allows to associate a sample to a given site /
scanner by a clustering method. Thus, the site/scanner can be defined by
dicom tags defining the machine (i.e. magnetic field, TI, TR …) or
metrics of image quality.

This repository has been coded to be compatible with
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`__ and thus facilitate
machine learning projects.

ImageComBat is under development and allows to normalize the image
directly (using Combat or AutoCombat) based on
`neuroHarmonize <https://github.com/rpomponio/neuroHarmonize>`__.
